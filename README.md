```

  username: your_username

```

## Usage - CLI

Performing basic search:

```
loggly-ruby-client -q testquery1
```

(If account is note specified loggly-ruby-client will look for the default account.)

Multiple queries can be specified and will be joined with **ANDs**:

```
loggly-ruby-client -q testquery1 -q testquery2
```

And inputs can be added, multile inputs will be joined with **ORs**:

```
loggly-ruby-client -q testquery1 -q testquery2 -i input1 -i input2
```

See help for full list of options:

```
loggly-ruby-client -h
```

```
require 'loggly-ruby-client'
config = LogglyRubyClient::Config.new(domain:'YOUR_DOMAIN',username:'USERNAME',password:'PASSWORD')
loggly = LogglyRubyClient::API.new(config: config)
```

Perform basic search:

```
loggly.search :from  => 'NOW-1HOUR',
              :query => ['testquery1'],
